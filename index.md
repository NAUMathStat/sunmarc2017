<p style="text-align:justify">The Southwestern Undergraduate Mathematics Research Conference brings together students and faculty from throughout the southwest for a weekend of mathematics. SUnMaRC is designed to provide opportunities for students to attend and/or
present mathematics research in a supportive and fun atmosphere.  In addition to student talks, there are invited speakers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The conference began in 2004 as the Arizona Mathematics Undergraduate Conference.  In 2008, the conference changed to SUnMaRC to recognize the participation of institutions throughout the southwest.</p>
