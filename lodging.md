The hotel is an 9-minute walk from the [Adel Mathematics building](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Adel+Mathematics+Center/@35.1908567,-111.6583235,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x872d8f6796f65c15:0x63271913fc89653a!8m2!3d35.1908567!4d-111.6561348), which is where most of the conference will take place. A block of 25 doubles and 8 singles is reserved for March 31-April 2.  The cost is $69/night + tax.  The doubles can hold 2-4 people and the cost is the same regardless of the number of occupants.  The hotel has light breakfast (e.g., cereal, oatmeal, hard-boiled eggs, some kind of pastry, juice, coffee, and tea) available in the morning at no additional cost. Faculty can call the hotel and reserve rooms that are blocked off for the "SUnMaRC mathematics conference".

There will also reserve a few rooms at the [Drury Inn]().  This hotel is a five-minute walk from Adel Mathematics, but will be more expensive (likely double the cost of the Howard Johnson Inn). More information will be made available in the next few days.
