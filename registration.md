title: Registration & Abstract Submission
---

The goal of the conference is to welcome undergraduates to the wonderful world of mathematics research, to develop and foster a rich social network between the mathematics students and faculty throughout the great Southwest, and to celebrate the accomplishments of our undergraduate students. We encourage undergraduate students from all years of study to participate and give presentations on all areas of mathematics, including applications to other disciplines. However, while we do recommend giving a talk, it is not a requirement for conference participation.

*Note to Faculty:* We recommend, if possible, that one faculty member from each school attend for every 4-6 students that participate.

The deadline for registration is **Monday, March 6**. The registration fee is TBA per participant. To have your department pay NAU directly, please contact [Bea Gallegos](emailto:Beatrice.Gallegos@nau.edu). Bea can send an invoice to your department for processing. If you do not need an invoice, you can send a check or money order to:
