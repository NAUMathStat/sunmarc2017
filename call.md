title: Call for Presentations
---

We encourage undergraduate students from all years of study to participate and give presentations in any area of mathematics, including applications to other disciplines. However, while we do recommend giving a talk, it is not a requirement for conference participation.

Student talks are 20 minutes long and should include time for questions at the end.  Topics can range from elementary known material to challenging generalizations of known theorems to entirely new results. Interesting applications of mathematics to other disciplines, as well as historical talks are also welcome. The organizers will attempt to group talks according to topic in parallel sessions. All talks will take place in rooms equipped with a computer, computer projector, laptop hookup, and whiteboard.
