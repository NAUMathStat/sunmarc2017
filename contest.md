Similar to Friday evening, the first student to submit a correct solution prior to 9:00pm will earn 2 points for themselves and for their school.

From 9:00pm on Saturday until 9:30am on Sunday, students may continue working on unsolved problems from Session 2, which they may submit prior to the first talk on Sunday morning.
