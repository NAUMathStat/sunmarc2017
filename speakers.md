<h2>Henry Segerman</h2>

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Segerman1.jpg" align="left" width="150" img style="margin: 8px 15px 0 0"/><a href="http://www.segerman.org">Henry Segerman</a> is an assistant professor in the department of mathematics at Oklahoma State University. His research interests are in three-dimensional geometry and topology, and in mathematical art and visualization. In visualization, he works mostly in the medium of 3D printing, with other interests in spherical video, virtual, and augmented reality. He is the author of the book <a href="http://www.3dprintmath.com">Visualizing Mathematics with 3D Printing</a>.</p>

<p><b>Title:</b> 3D Shadows: Casting light on the fourth dimension</p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Our brains have evolved in a three-dimensional environment, and so we are very good at visualizing two- and three-dimensional objects. But what about four-dimensional objects? The best we can really do is to look at three-dimensional "shadows". Just as a shadow of a three-dimensional object squishes it into the two-dimensional plane, we can squish a four-dimensional shape into three-dimensional space, where we can then make a sculpture of it. If the four-dimensional object isn't too complicated and we choose a good way to squish it, then we can get a very good sense of what it is like. We will explore the sphere in four-dimensional space, the four-dimensional polytopes (which are the four-dimensional versions of the three-dimensional polyhedra), and various 3D printed sculptures, puzzles, and virtual reality experiences that have come from thinking about these things. I talk about these topics and much more in my new book, "Visualizing Mathematics with 3D Printing".</p>

<h2>Kathryn Bryant</h2>

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Bryant.jpg" align="left" width="150" img style="margin: 8px 15px 0 0"/>Kathryn Bryant is a Visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Colorado College. She received her Ph.D. from Bryn Mawr College in May 2016 and is an alumna of Northern Arizona University. Her primary area of research is in low-dimensional topology, within which she studies questions in the intersection of knot theory and 4-manifold theory. Kathryn's secondary area of research is in applied topology, with a current project looking at the applications of persistent homology to topographical pattern recognition in geophysical (geological) data. When she is not thinking about math in its varied capacities, she enjoys running, yoga, and finding and consuming the best almond croissants in town.</p>
