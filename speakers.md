<h2>Henry Segerman</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify"><a href="http://www.segerman.org">Henry Segerman</a> is an assistant professor in the department of mathematics at Oklahoma State University. His research interests are in three-dimensional geometry and topology, and in mathematical art and visualization. In visualization, he works mostly in the medium of 3D printing, with other interests in spherical video, virtual, and augmented reality. He is the author of the book <a href="http://www.3dprintmath.com">Visualizing Mathematics with 3D Printing</a>.</p>

<h2>Kathryn Bryant</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Bryant.jpg" align="right" width="130" img style="margin: 10px 0 0 15px"/>Kathryn Bryant is a Visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Colorado College. She received her Ph.D. from Bryn Mawr College in May 2016 and is an alumna of Northern Arizona University. Her primary area of research is in low-dimensional topology, within which she studies questions in the intersection of knot theory and 4-manifold theory. Kathryn's secondary area of research is in applied topology, with a current project looking at the applications of persistent homology to topographical pattern recognition in geophysical (geological) data. When she is not thinking about math in its varied capacities, she enjoys running, yoga, and finding and consuming the best almond croissants in town.</p>
